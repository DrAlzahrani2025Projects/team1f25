User Acceptance Testing (UAT) package.

This package contains UAT tests that validate the system from an end-user perspective.
Tests are organized into:

1. test_user_scenarios.py - Real user scenarios (students, faculty, librarians)
2. test_acceptance_criteria.py - Business requirements and acceptance criteria

UAT tests use realistic user queries and validate:
- Natural language understanding
- User experience quality
- Business requirements fulfillment
- End-to-end workflows
- Error handling and recovery
