# Class TestRagAgent:
#     Method test_build_context_formats_hits():
#         # Arrange: create hits list with mixed completeness (titles, sources, links, scores)
#         # Act: call _build_context(hits) -> returns (context_str, normalized_hits)
#         # Assert: context_str contains numbered headers and trimmed texts
#         #   - "[1] Doc One â€” https://example/one"
#         #   - "Some text for doc1."
#         #   - "[2] SourceTwo"
#         #   - "Second document text."
#         #   - "[3] doc3" (fallback to id when title/source missing)
#         # Assert: normalized_hits length == 3 and each item has keys: id, text, meta, score
#         # Assert: text fields are trimmed / defaulted:
#         #   - normalized_hits[0].text == "Some text for doc1."
#         #   - normalized_hits[1].text == "Second document text."
#         #   - normalized_hits[2].text == "" (missing text becomes empty)

#     Method test_rag_answer_calls_dependencies():
#         # Patch Embedder to return [[0.1, 0.2, 0.3]] when embed([question]) is called
#         # Patch get_collection to return a fake collection handle
#         # Patch query to return two fake hits: ids "a" and "b" with titles/text/scores
#         # Patch QroqClient to have chat(...) return "This is a mocked answer."
#         # Act: call rag_answer(question="What is the test?", top_k=2) -> res
#         # Assert: Embedder.embed called once with [question]
#         # Assert: get_collection called once
#         # Assert: query called once with:
#         #   - first positional arg == fake collection
#         #   - second positional arg == [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]
#         #   - keyword arg top_k == 2
#         # Assert: QroqClient.chat called once
#         # Assert: res["answer"] == "This is a mocked answer."
#         # Assert: res["hits"] length == 2 and ids are "a", "b" in order
